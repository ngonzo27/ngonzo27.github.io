## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 4 Part 2:

    Lab 4 part 2 was a fun lab because we made a game where one player enters a secret and the other player tries to guess what that number was. We used if statements and relational operators to determine if player 2 guessed a number that was correct, too high, or too low. Because this was one of our first times using if statements to determine an output it was quite the learning experience. 

* Lab 6 Part 2:

    Lab 6 part 2 was a interesting lab where we created a program that calculated the total score of a blackjack hand based on the card type, value, and whether an ace bonus could be used or not. It was a bit of a challenge to write, as it required a lot of if statements, logical operators, and user-defined functions that made it hard to see how everything connects. It was one of the first times we used vectors and command line arguments as our inputs. 

* Lab 7:

    I enjoyed lab 7 because it was somewhat complex in using boolean expressions and relational operators to determine if you can park on a given street on a specific day and time. It was fun because we got to see how relational operators can be used to shorten parameters used to output a true or false value. Although it was only a one part lab, it still took a lot of work and time to complete.
